0.7.2 - Fixed ASCII bug

0.7.1 - Changed from Depends (from older version of R) to Imports

0.6.2 - Changed to semantic versioning. Added catch for users trying to get indices from multiple threshold approach when none of the coefficients of interest are different from 0.

0.6-1 - Fixed error in getMaxFuncs that was leading to one additional sample being pulled to calculate max values

0.6.0 - Fixed error in getMaxFuncs that was leading to bad row indices and no max being calculated
